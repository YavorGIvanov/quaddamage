How to set it up on your machine
--------------------------------

On Windows:
-----------
   run scripts/download_sdk.py (requires Python 2.7, a prebuilt exe can be downloaded from [here](http://raytracing-bg.net/lib/download_sdk.exe)) to download and set up the SDKs and follow the instructions.
   This will install SDL and OpenEXR in a SDK/ subdirectory of the project, copy SDL.dll to this directory, and copy the project files from the versioned templates to a local, untracked copy.

On Linux and Mac OS X:
----------------------
   run scripts/downloda_sdk.py, and follow the instructions.
